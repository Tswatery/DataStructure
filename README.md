Recently, I find that some data structures are very significant in CS. Such as B tree, B+ tree, red black tree and so on. I ignored them before because they were too hard. 

I was in my fourth year in colledge and I am going to get a postgraduate degree. I think I am lack of some basic coding skills like object oriented programming in some modern languages such as Java and Python, not to metion design patterns and some advanced programming skills.

So it's high time for me to learn how to code elegently and efficiently, I decide to start from those data structures using C++ and Python first. I'll encapsulate them into classes and we can be able to call them nicely in other files.

Todo:

Tree: B tree, B+ tree, red black tree, Trie....
